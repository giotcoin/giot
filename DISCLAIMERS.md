# Disclaimers for Fundraiser Participants

* The Essential giot Software and Services may not complete in the advertised
  timeline due to unforeseen issues and circumstances.

* The giot Hub may not gain significant market adoption due to a failure for
  the give holders to coorinate effectively, or due to competition.

* The first 6 hours of the Fundraiser is uncapped, so there may be significant
  dillution relative to the total number of gives at Genesis.

* There may be unintended bugs in software and theory that cause the project to
  fail for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, bugs in
Tendermint Core, bugs in the giot Hub ABCI application, bugs in client or
wallet software, etc.

* There may be irreconciliable differences among give holders that cause the
  giot Hub blockchain to split (hard-fork) into two or more blockchains.  This
may cause economic harm for end-users and related services such as
crypto-exchanges .

* A majority or supermajority of the give holders may pass proposals that go
  against the interest of the remaining give holders.
